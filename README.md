`flutter_buttombar_chung` is a Flutter package that provides a bottom navigation bar with a wave effect. This bottom navigation bar has the following features and options:

- `items`: The list of items in the bottom navigation bar.
- `index`: The index of the currently selected item.
- `color`: The color of the navigation bar.
- `buttonBackgroundColor`: The background color of the button.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the navigation bar.
- `onTap`: The callback function when an item is tapped.
- `letIndexChange`: The function to allow index change.
- `animationCurve`: The animation curve.
- `animationDuration`: The duration of the animation.
- `height`: The height of the navigation bar.

In addition, this package provides the `FlutterButtombarChungItem` class for creating items in the bottom navigation bar. Each item has an icon (`child`), an optional label (`label`), and an optional label style (`labelStyle`).
